# Getting Started with React: A Beginner's Guide

React has revolutionized the way we build web applications. In this guide, we'll walk through the basics of getting started with React and create your first component.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook.

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, you'll need Node.js installed. Then create a new React project using:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm start
```

## Your First Component

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
```
