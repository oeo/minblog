# Docker Fundamentals: Containers Made Simple

Docker has transformed how we deploy applications. Let's understand the basics of containerization.

## What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run an application:
- Code
- Runtime
- System tools
- Libraries
- Settings

## Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull ubuntu

# Run a container
docker run -it ubuntu

# List containers
docker ps
```

## Creating a Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
