# Python for Data Science: Essential Libraries

Python has become the go-to language for data science. Let's explore the most important libraries you need to know.

## NumPy

NumPy is fundamental for numerical computing in Python. It provides:
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Mathematical functions
- Linear algebra operations

## Pandas

Pandas is essential for data manipulation and analysis:
- DataFrames for structured data
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data analysis and visualization

## Example Code

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create sample data
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
df = pd.DataFrame({'numbers': data})
```

Next time, we'll dive deeper into data visualization!
